# Python-Learning-Path
This repository documents my Python learning journey — from beginner to intermediate level — through hands-on practice, structured modules, and real-world mini projects. It includes key concepts like data types, control flow, functions, OOP, data analysis with Pandas and NumPy, automation scripts, API usage, and web app development.
